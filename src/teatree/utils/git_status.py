    index, missing dir) is indistinguishable from a genuinely clean tree. For a

    """Return a single patch covering staged, unstaged, AND untracked changes.

    ``git diff HEAD`` alone omits untracked files. Marking them intent-to-add
    (``git add -N``) makes them appear in the diff as new-file hunks (without
    staging their content), so a single ``git apply`` of the returned patch
    restores edits and brand-new files alike. The intent-to-add marks are
    harmless: the worktree is about to be removed.

    ``base`` is the revision the working tree is diffed against — ``HEAD`` for
    a normal worktree. A dangling-HEAD worktree (forge post-merge ref deletion)
    has no resolvable ``HEAD`` (``git diff HEAD`` exits 128), so the caller
    passes the recovered tip SHA instead, so the patch still captures the
    genuine uncommitted delta on top of that tip.

    The prefixes are forced explicitly with ``--src-prefix=a/
    --dst-prefix=b/``: ``git diff`` otherwise honours the caller's git config,
    and a user with ``diff.noprefix=true`` (common) would get a patch with no
    ``a/``/``b/`` prefixes that a plain ``git apply`` cannot restore — total
    loss of the captured work, the exact #835 scenario. Forcing the prefixes
    keeps the patch standard and ``git apply``-able regardless of user config.
