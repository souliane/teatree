"""The IMPLEMENT phase — synthetic mechanism ticket + normal maker pipeline (north-star PR-7).

Cloned from :func:`teatree.loops.outer_loop.implement.schedule_experiment_fix`: an
ADMITTED directive whose sketch is a ``setting_policy_gate`` anchors an ``AUTHOR``
``Ticket`` on a unique synthetic issue URL and rides :meth:`Ticket.schedule_coding`
— the SAME isolated-worktree → plan gate → design/quality critic → cold review →
critic-gated merge keystone every ticket uses. The self-modification code is held
to the clean bar by those gates for free; the directive loop gains ZERO new merge
authority. ``extra["directive_id"]`` links the ticket back so the directive-scoped
plan gates (PR-3's ``mechanism_placement``) key on it.

The admission baseline is snapshotted here (mirroring the outer loop's propose-time
baseline) so VERIFYING's no-collateral-regression evidence has a reference.
