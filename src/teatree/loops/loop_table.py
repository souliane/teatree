"""Loop-table fan-out — dispatch each row via its OWN load-bearing column (#1796, #2513, #2584).

The cutover from the code-cadence tick: the fan-out no longer consults a
code-cadence ledger to decide whether a mini-loop should fire — the DB ``Loop``
row carries cadence + the enable toggle, and ``Loop.last_run_at`` is the single
cadence ledger. #2584 closes the gap the #2513 cutover opened: a loop runs this
tick iff it is NOT ``off_live_tick`` AND its ``Loop`` row is ``enabled`` and
``is_due(now)`` (its own ``delay_seconds`` interval, or its ``daily_at``
wall-clock schedule) AND ``LoopsConfig.is_enabled`` agrees. ``LoopsConfig.is_enabled``
resolves through the durable ``LoopState`` control tier only (``t3 loop pause`` /
``disable``, #1913) — there is no env kill-switch and no ``[loops]`` toml
disabled-state tier. ``row.enabled`` AND ``LoopsConfig.is_enabled`` together are
the single enable verdict (``Loop.enabled`` + ``loop_held_in_db``) — the same
verdict the dream cron gate, the review-claim chokepoint, and the #2650 cron
mirror resolve through ``teatree.loop.loop_state_db.loop_enabled``, so no
enable-decision site drifts into a tier-subset.

**The ``script``/``prompt`` column is LOAD-BEARING (#2513 regression fix).** The
fan-out no longer selects an admitted row's behaviour by a name-only registry
lookup (the regression that left the DB ``script`` column dead). For each admitted
row it READS the column: a **script** row's ``script`` is resolved to the loop's
OWN name (:func:`teatree.loops.run.parse_script_loop_name`) and THAT loop's
``build_jobs`` fans out — a row whose ``script`` does not resolve to a real
registered loop module raises and is logged + skipped (never a silent no-op); a
**prompt** row dispatches its own loop's ``build_jobs`` (its scanner queues the
prompt-instructed work). So which behaviour fans out is decided by the row's
column, not by its name.

An ``off_live_tick`` loop (the heavy ``dream`` consolidation pass, #1933 § 3) is
NEVER picked up here — the live tick must not invoke its ``build_jobs`` or bump
its ``last_run_at``; it is driven by its own low-frequency cron. The
``LoopsConfig.is_enabled`` check runs BEFORE the cadence claim so a held loop is
neither dispatched nor cadence-bumped — its anchor is preserved, not silently
consumed. The fan-out then ATOMICALLY claims an admitted loop's ``last_run_at``
(a compare-and-swap on the anchor it read, :meth:`LoopManager.mark_run_if_unchanged`)
BEFORE building its jobs, so two ticks that read the same anchor cannot both
drive the loop — exactly one wins the claim and dispatches.

This is the ``jobs_builder`` the per-loop tick (``t3 loops tick --loop <name>``)
injects into the shared :func:`teatree.loop.tick.run_tick` pipeline, so reap +
scan + act + render are reused unchanged — only the gate (which loops run, on
whose cadence) moves from code into the DB rows + the unified verdict.
