"""Per-phase headless model tiering by ABSTRACT TIER (#880, #562 §3).

Every concrete Claude model id in teatree lives in EXACTLY ONE place: the
:data:`TIER_MODELS` constant below (the ``claude_sdk`` catalog; the
``pydantic_ai``/OrcaRouter harness has its own :data:`PYDANTIC_AI_TIER_MODELS`
catalog — see the harness-scoped note below). Everything else — production phase
dispatch, eval scenarios, the benchmark, and the tests — references an abstract
TIER (``frontier`` / ``balanced`` / ``cheap``), never a concrete model id.
Adopting a new model is one edit to :data:`TIER_MODELS` (or one
``agent_tier_models`` DB row), with zero scenario, test, or dispatch edits.

The three tiers map to the price points #562 reasons about: ``frontier`` is the
full-reasoning tier (genuine design work), ``balanced`` the mid tier, ``cheap``
the mechanical tier. :func:`resolve_tier` reads :data:`TIER_MODELS` (overridable
via ``agent_tier_models``); :data:`DEFAULT_PHASE_MODELS` maps each FSM phase to
a tier, and :func:`resolve_phase_model` / :func:`resolve_spawn_model` resolve
phase → tier → concrete model id.

The reasoning-effort dial is the parallel single-source constant
:data:`TIER_EFFORT` (abstract tier → effort), read via
:func:`resolve_tier_effort`; :func:`resolve_spawn_effort` resolves phase → tier →
effort exactly as :func:`resolve_phase_model` resolves phase → tier → model
(same ``phase_models`` override mechanism). Only the reasoning tiers carry an
effort by default — ``cheap`` (Haiku, which rejects the lever) is absent, so its
spawns emit no effort and inherit the SDK default.

**Harness-scoped model + effort ([#2885](https://github.com/souliane/teatree/issues/2885)).**
:data:`TIER_MODELS` is the ``claude_sdk`` catalog — Claude ids in DASH-form
(``claude-opus-4-8``). The ``pydantic_ai`` harness's OrcaRouter provider does NOT
carry those dash-form ids (Orca serves provider-prefixed ids —
``anthropic/claude-opus-4.8``, the open-source pool, and named router handles), so its
catalog is the SEPARATE :data:`PYDANTIC_AI_TIER_MODELS` (all tiers collapsing to
one router handle; the router's own bandit does the mundane-vs-hard tiering).
:func:`resolve_pydantic_ai_model` is the boundary that normalises a resolved
teatree-native id UP to that router handle for the OrcaRouter harness, while an
explicit Orca-native pin passes through. The reasoning-EFFORT dial is
similarly harness-scoped: the two harnesses' supported effort vocabularies are not identical —
the ``claude-agent-sdk`` CLI's scale tops out at ``max``
(:data:`teatree.config_agent.EFFORT_SCALE`), while ``pydantic_ai``'s OpenAI-compatible
``ReasoningEffort`` tops out at ``xhigh`` (no ``max``) — so :func:`resolve_tier_effort`
/ :func:`resolve_spawn_effort` validate their resolved value against the ACTIVE
harness's :data:`HARNESS_EFFORT_SCALE` entry and drop an out-of-range value (falling
back to the shipped default) rather than ever handing a harness an effort string it
does not understand. The shipped :data:`TIER_EFFORT` values (``xhigh`` / ``high``)
are valid on both scales today, so this is a no-op for the shipped defaults; it only
narrows an operator's ``agent_tier_effort`` override.

The mapping is config-driven from the DB ``ConfigSetting`` store, read via
:mod:`teatree.config.cold_reader`. Set the per-phase → tier map and the tier
overrides with ``t3 <overlay> config_setting set``::

    t3 <overlay> config_setting set agent_phase_models '{"reviewing": "frontier", "testing": ""}'
    t3 <overlay> config_setting set agent_tier_models '{"frontier": "claude-opus-4-9"}'
    t3 <overlay> config_setting set agent_tier_effort '{"balanced": "xhigh"}'

An ``agent_phase_models`` entry may name a TIER (resolved through
:func:`resolve_tier`) or a concrete model id (passed through unchanged), so a
power user can still pin a specific model. A sentinel value (empty / ``default``
/ ``inherit``) returns ``None`` so no ``--model`` flag is added and the user's
configured default applies unchanged.
