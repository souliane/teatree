r"""Bash command surface parsing for the quote-scanner gate (#1213).

Extracted from :mod:`teatree.hooks.quote_scanner` to keep that module
under the project's per-file LOC ceiling. The public quote-scanner API
(scan_text, format_*, log_decision, extract_publish_payload,
has_quote_ok_override) lives in ``quote_scanner.py`` and delegates the
shell-grammar work to the helpers here.

The parser walks a Bash command string in two passes:

1. :mod:`teatree.hooks._shell_lexer` produces a token stream where bash
    shell grammar is honoured (``\<NL>`` removed token-internally,
    ``;``/``|``/``&``/``&&``/``||`` emitted as standalone metachars
    regardless of whitespace, ANSI-C ``$'...'`` decoded properly per
    the bash man-page).
2. Per-command argument walkers iterate over the WORD tokens of each
    command segment and pull out body-flag values, heredoc-style content,
    and attached short-option payloads (``-d'{...}'``).

Indirect body sources we cannot inspect (``gh api --input -``, opaque
``-d @file`` references, a missing ``git commit -F`` message file) fail
closed via a sentinel string that downstream scanning treats as a HIGH
match. A missing ``gh``/``glab`` ``--body-file`` is the one exception:
an absent drafted PR/issue body is "needs-inline", not a leak, so it
contributes no payload rather than a fail-closed HIGH (#126).

Publish-surface DETECTION (which command shapes are a publish at all) lives
in :mod:`teatree.hooks._publish_detection`: the contiguous-substring catalogue
here plus the token-aware ``api`` / ``git commit`` / opaque-forge-transport
classifiers there, so an interspersed persistent flag cannot break detection
(#1672). This module owns body / title / secret-surface EXTRACTION.

    (``>"$f"``) redirect spellings are handled.

    Conservative by construction: the writer's operands (every WORD between the
    command name and the ``>``/``>>`` redirect) are joined verbatim. Over-
    including a ``%s`` format token only ADDS text to what the gate scans; it

    r"""Concatenate every body-like fragment the command surface carries.

    The command is tokenized once via :mod:`teatree.hooks._shell_lexer`
    so shell-equivalent spellings (line continuations both token-
    internal and between-token, ANSI-C ``$'...'`` quoting, unspaced
    metacharacters) collapse to the same logical token stream bash
    itself would execute. Then each command segment is routed to the
    right per-command argument walker.

    Indirect body sources (``gh api --input -``, missing files, opaque
    ``-d @file`` references) fail closed via the sentinel. A
    ``--body-file``/``-F <path>`` reference whose body is written earlier in
    the same command — by a ``> path <<EOF … EOF`` heredoc (#126) or by a
    ``printf``/``echo > path`` redirect, including when the path is the same
    unexpanded ``$f`` / ``$(mktemp)`` token in both the write and the
    reference — resolves to that in-command body instead of failing closed.

    ``fail_closed_body_file`` controls an UNREADABLE ``gh``/``glab`` body
    file: ``False`` (default, the quote scanner) keeps the #126 behaviour
    (an absent draft body contributes nothing); ``True`` (the
    destination-aware banned-terms / bare-reference gates) appends the
    fail-closed sentinel so a PUBLIC file-body post whose body the gate
    cannot read hard-blocks instead of slipping through unread.

    A ``git commit -F <relpath>`` body file is resolved against the dir whose
    repo the commit LANDS in (the command's own ``cd``/``-C``/``--git-dir``,
    via :func:`_body_file_resolution.commit_body_file_base`); a ``cd <dir> && gh
    pr create --body-file <relpath>`` body file is resolved against the command's
    leading ``cd`` dir (:func:`_body_file_resolution.command_body_file_base`);
    else the harness-provided ``cwd``. This handles the cold hook's reset cwd, so
    the gate scans the real body and applies the private-repo carve-out instead
    of fail-closing on a clean post whose body it could not read.
