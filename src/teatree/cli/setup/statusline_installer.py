"""Install the top-level ``statusLine`` block into ``~/.claude/settings.json`` (PR-17).

Claude Code reads the statusline command from the user's ``settings.json``, not
from a plugin-distributed one — so ``t3 setup`` writes the block pointing at the
main clone's ``hooks/scripts/statusline.sh`` (absolute path, computed portably).
The plugin's own ``settings.json`` must NOT carry a ``statusLine`` block, or it
would try to distribute one statusline command to every user of the plugin.

Never clobbers: an existing ``statusLine`` block (the user may have pointed it
somewhere deliberate) is left untouched. The companion doctor check
(:func:`teatree.cli._doctor_checks._check_statusline`) verifies presence,
absolute path, and executability with exact remediation.
