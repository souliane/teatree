"""Tick-piggyback safety net for the reactive slots (#1107 Prong B).

Defense-in-depth for the #1107 incident. Prong A fixes the headline root
cause (``current_session_id()`` could not resolve an owner in agent-driven
mode, so ``t3 loop claim`` hard-refused and the owner-gated reactive slots
were permanently dead). Prong B is the independent safety net: even in a
pure-cron / no-session deployment where Prong A still cannot resolve an
owner, a *won* ``t3 loop tick`` — the one beat that is guaranteed to keep
running — also drives the reactive Slack-answer cycle and the cheap
self-improve tier so user DMs still get :eyes:/answered and smells still
get recorded.

The piggyback runs ONLY on the won-owner success path of
``loop_tick.Command.handle`` (AFTER the ``loop-tick`` lease ``finally``,
AFTER the #1073 owner gate). A non-owner foreign-session SKIP must NOT
piggyback — that would re-open the #1073 hijack (a foreign session
draining the user's Slack DMs). ``loop_tick`` enforces that by calling
this only past the owner gate.

Each cycle is guarded by its own dedicated ``LoopLease`` CAS — the SAME
lease a real dedicated ``loop-slack-answer`` / ``loop-self-improve`` slot
acquires (``loop_slack_answer.py`` / ``loop_self_improve.py``). If a real
slot already holds it the piggyback's CAS loses and it skips, so the
#1014/#1075 dedicated fast path is never double-run. The lease is acquired
with a per-tick-unique owner and ``lease_seconds=<cadence>`` and is NEVER
released here: that makes the lease TTL double as the throttle — a
re-tick inside the cadence window finds the lease still held by the
previous tick's (different) owner, loses the CAS, and skips. Zero new
state, zero new columns.
