"""Deterministic pre-post validation of test-plan images.

The preflight the ``e2e post-test-plan`` command runs over every image the
manifest references BEFORE any upload or post. It refuses the whole post
(fail-loud) when an image is not a real piece of test-plan evidence, so the user never has
to manually spot a red-box-less screenshot or a pasted-twice look-alike after
the fact:

*   **Red-box gate** — every image must carry a red highlight box (the
    ``highlightAndShoot`` style is ``outline:3px solid red`` + a red box-shadow).
    A meaningful count of saturated-red pixels (``R≥200, G≤80, B≤80``) consistent
    with an outline must be present; a plain full-page screenshot with no
    highlight is refused by name. The threshold sits in the clean gap between
    real test-plan crops (3660-6490 saturated-red px in the reference set) and the
    largest incidental red UI element in a plain shot (≈1667 px).
*   **Duplicate gate** — no two images may be byte-identical (the "several
    screenshots look the same" failure). The colliding pair is named.
*   **Staleness check** — an image dramatically older than the freshest in the
    set is WARNED about (not refused): a dev-environment image is legitimately
    frozen while a fresh local run posts alongside it.

Pure pixel/byte/mtime logic over on-disk paths — no ORM, no host, no network —
so it unit-tests in isolation. ``skip=True`` is the user-authorised escape hatch
(the agent never sets it on its own); it runs nothing dangerous, just returns no
warnings without refusing.
