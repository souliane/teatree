    The merge-approval gate is a property of the **repo**, not of whatever
    overlay token a ticket happens to carry. A repo's OWNING overlay
    (:func:`infer_overlay_for_url` over every overlay's ``get_workspace_repos``)
    is authoritative — a repo resolves to its OWNING overlay even when the
    linked ticket was mis-stamped with a different overlay at creation.
    Resolving the stored ``ticket.overlay`` first inverted this: a ticket
    created while the agent was typed as a *different* overlay (the
    ``T3_OVERLAY_NAME`` the CLI bridge stamps, or a loop scanner setting
    ``ticket.overlay = self.overlay_name``) carried the WRONG overlay, so a PR
    on a repo governed by a ``full`` overlay was evaluated under a below-full
    overlay and refused. This is the name-collision trap: two overlays can carry
    similar names while owning disjoint repo sets — the repo's owning overlay,
    not the typed token, decides the gate.

    Resolution order, first non-empty wins:

    1.  :func:`infer_overlay_for_url` on the CLEAR's stored ``slug`` — the repo's
        OWNING overlay, authoritative. Resolves only when the stored slug is an
        ``owner/repo`` (the merge-authorization path stores ``owner/repo``).
    2.  :func:`infer_overlay_for_url` on *resolved_slug* — the real
        ``owner/repo`` the merge keystone recovered for this CLEAR
        (:func:`resolve_pr_repo_slug` →
        :func:`_reconcile_slug_against_reviewed_sha`). The loop routinely
        issues a ticket-less substrate CLEAR whose stored ``slug`` is a *branch
        name* (``merge-candidate-working-repos``), not ``owner/repo`` — step 1
        returns ``""`` for it, so this step resolves the SAME repo the bound
        merge targets.
    3.  ``clear.ticket.overlay`` — the stored token, the LAST resort. Used only
        when repo identity is inconclusive (no overlay claims either slug, e.g.
        a repo not yet declared in any overlay's ``workspace_repos``), so an
        existing attribution is never discarded for a blank inference.

    Returns ``""`` when no source resolves an overlay (the fail-closed default).
