"""Local text-to-speech egress — the ``speak(text)`` seam (#1791).

A single chokepoint that reads the resolved :class:`~teatree.types.SpeakMode`
+ :class:`~teatree.types.SpeakTarget` and, when enabled, reads agent text
aloud. Two call sites drive it:

*   ``im-only`` / ``all`` — :func:`teatree.core.notify.notify_user` calls
    :func:`speak` for every bot→user IM/DM egress.
*   ``all`` — the Stop hook (``handle_speak_all_on_stop``) calls
    :func:`speak` with the transcript's last assistant text block.

The whole feature is gated on the macOS ``say`` binary being on ``PATH``
(:func:`binary_available`): when it is absent :func:`resolve_mode` forces
``off`` regardless of config, so the feature is simply inert off macOS — no
error, no nag. Cloud TTS (OpenAI / ElevenLabs) is a possible later backend
behind this same seam; out of scope here.

Delivery is governed by :class:`~teatree.types.SpeakTarget`:

*   ``local`` — ``say -o`` synthesises an AIFF, ``afconvert`` transcodes to
    ``.m4a``, and ``afplay`` plays it through the speakers. macOS-only; each
    step is independently no-op when its binary is absent.
*   ``slack-audio`` — the same ``.m4a`` is uploaded to the user's Slack DM
    via the messaging backend so the spoken reply reaches his phone.
*   ``both`` — both legs.

Every leg is non-blocking (spawned in a daemon thread / detached process)
and never raises into the caller's egress / Stop path — a failure to
synthesise or play locally is logged at debug and dropped. A failed
``slack-audio`` upload is additionally surfaced to the user once per error
class via a text DM (:func:`_surface_upload_failure`), so a missing
``files:write`` scope can't silently masquerade as working delivery.
