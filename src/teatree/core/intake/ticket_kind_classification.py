"""Canonical ``FEATURE`` vs ``FIX`` classification for every ticket-intake site (#17).

``Ticket.Kind.FIX`` gates two downstream consumers — the S2 defect-escape signal
(:func:`teatree.core.factory.factory_signal_queries.compute_s2`) and the fix-record
Definition-of-Done merge gate (:mod:`teatree.core.gates.fix_dod_gate`) — yet
before #17 no production path ever *wrote* it, so S2 read a vacuous FEATURE-only
world and the DoD gate was a permanent no-op contradicting BLUEPRINT.md.

This module is the single writer. Every site that creates a ticket routes its kind
decision through :func:`classify_ticket_kind`, so the classification can never
diverge across sites:

* ``teatree.core.intake.resolve`` — auto-registering a manually-added git worktree.
* ``teatree.core.management.commands._workspace_ticket_intake`` — ``workspace ticket``.
* ``teatree.core.management.commands.tasks`` — ``tasks create --kind``.
* ``teatree.loop.persistence`` — correction-zone handlers (red-card/red-MR-fix/e2e-fix/skill-drift) are FIX by origin.
