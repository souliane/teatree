"""Review-state gate on the review-request broadcast (PR-08).

The hole this forecloses: a review-request broadcast goes out for a ticket
whose FSM never reached REVIEWED (no cold review ran) — colleagues are pinged
to review work that was not itself reviewed first. Skill prose says "review
before you request review", but nothing mechanically refuses the broadcast.

This is the structural gate. A broadcast is refused unless BOTH hold:

* the ticket's FSM state is ``REVIEWED``, and
* a recorded review-evidence artifact exists — a
    :class:`~teatree.core.models.review_evidence.ReviewEvidence` cold-review
    row, OR an existing
    :class:`~teatree.core.models.review_verdict.ReviewVerdict` for the ticket.
    Accepting the verdict keeps the artifact **recordable by the cold-review
    step**: that step already records a ``ReviewVerdict``, so a normal
    reviewed-and-cleared flow satisfies the gate with no extra step.

``require_reviewed_state_for_review_request`` is ``False`` unless configured —
with it unset the gate is a NO-OP, so a project that does not require it keeps
requesting review unchanged. The gate is a pure function over durable state; on
a block it returns a non-empty refusal string (the review-request post command
surfaces it as a non-zero exit), mirroring
:mod:`teatree.core.gates.anti_vacuity_gate`.
