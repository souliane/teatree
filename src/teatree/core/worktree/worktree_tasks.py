"""Per-worktree FSM task workers.

These four ``@task`` functions back the
``Worktree.provision/start_services/verify/teardown`` transitions
(BLUEPRINT §4). Each worker takes a row lock and re-checks state before
running so at-least-once delivery is safe.

Lives in its own module so ``teatree.core.tasks`` stays under the
module-health function-count cap. Workers are kept as module-level
functions because ``django.tasks`` discovers and serialises them by
qualified name.
