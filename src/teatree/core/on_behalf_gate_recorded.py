"""Recorded-approval orchestration for the on-behalf pre-gate (#960/#961).

``teatree.on_behalf_gate`` holds the pure setting resolver
(``ask_before_post_on_behalf_enabled``) — it depends only on
``teatree.config`` and stays in that thin layer. The *satisfiable*
channel needs the :class:`~teatree.core.models.on_behalf_approval.OnBehalfApproval`
/ :class:`~teatree.core.models.on_behalf_approval.OnBehalfAudit` ORM models,
so its orchestration lives here in ``teatree.core`` (which legitimately
depends on both ``teatree.on_behalf_gate`` and ``teatree.core.models``),
exactly as #953 split ``teatree.utils.approval`` (pure) from
``teatree.core.db_approval_gate`` (ORM-backed).

:func:`require_on_behalf_approval` is the single chokepoint helper every
on-behalf publish path calls *before* it publishes. It is a real,
satisfiable, universal gate with three outcomes:

* gate **OFF** (the user trusts the overlay) → return, the post proceeds;
* gate **ON** + a recorded, unconsumed, exactly-scoped
    :class:`OnBehalfApproval` exists → consume it single-use, write an
    :class:`OnBehalfAudit` row, return — the post proceeds;
* gate **ON** + no recorded approval → raise :class:`OnBehalfPostBlockedError`.
    The caller must NOT publish; it surfaces the blocked post to the user
    (the user-notify path) so the user can approve it in plain text by
    recording an approval — never a silent drop, never an unattended post.

Default ON, fail-closed: an unresolved setting defaults to ON, and ON
with no approval blocks. The user satisfies the gate **without a TTY** via
``t3 review approve-on-behalf <target> <action> --approver <id>`` (the
#777/#953 interactive-TTY-only anti-pattern is deliberately avoided).
