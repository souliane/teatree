"""Public-repo author-trust classifier — the shared seam (#1773).

The merge keystone and the four reviewing scanners (``pr_sweep``,
``codex_review``, ``slack_broadcasts``, the mechanical handlers) all need the
SAME answer to one question: "on this repo, is this PR author the user?" One
helper owns that decision so the consumers cannot drift apart.

Trust model (BLUEPRINT §17.4). On a PUBLIC repo, anyone who is not the user is
a potential malicious actor; the author must be a trusted identity to be
auto-mergeable. On a PRIVATE / internal repo the user controls access, so there
is NO author check — any author is allowed.

Resolution. Visibility uses the shared host-qualified private-repo rule: a
reachable PUBLIC forge answer wins, and a matching declaration stands when
the probe cannot answer. An UNRESOLVABLE visibility requires trust. The trust
set is DB :class:`TrustedIdentity`
rows first; an EMPTY table or a pre-migration database error falls back to the
configured ``user_identity_aliases`` so the migration window never regresses.

Fail-closed: an EMPTY / unknown author on a public repo is untrusted; the
caller (the keystone, the sweep) refuses the auto-merge.
