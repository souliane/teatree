"""The ``tasks list --session`` view: the session-scoped teatree tasks.

This view renders **only** the teatree *tasks* — rows in the DB-backed
``Task`` model — scoped to the current harness session, grouped pending /
in_progress / completed.

It deliberately does NOT render the *harness TODO* list (the agent harness's
own ``TaskCreate`` / ``TaskUpdate`` items). That list lives in the harness's
live, in-memory session state, and the Task tools bypass ``PreToolUse`` /
``PostToolUse`` hooks (a known harness regression — see
``docs/claude-code-internals.md`` § 9), so a ``t3`` CLI subprocess can only
read a stale on-disk snapshot (``~/.claude/tasks/<session>/*.json``) that lags
the live session and is never reliably in sync. ``/t3:todos`` therefore builds
the harness half **dynamically from the live ``TaskList`` harness tool** — not
from this CLI. Keeping the CLI's session view scoped to the teatree ``Task``
rows means it can never masquerade as the live session todo list.

``read_harness_todos`` remains here for the one **hook** consumer that
genuinely cannot call the live ``TaskList`` tool — the PreCompact recovery
snapshot (``hook_router._durable_session_snapshot``). It reads the harness's
OWN on-disk store (``~/.claude/tasks/<session>/*.json``); that is a best-effort,
point-in-time capture inside a hook subprocess, and a lagging disk read is the
only option there and an acceptable one (a snapshot is a moment in time anyway).
There is NO teatree-written mirror of the harness list (the old
``<session>.todos`` materialiser was removed — it was a stale mistake-source
that nothing load-bearing read). The reconciliation discipline that keeps the
LIVE harness TODO list faithful belongs to the in-session agent, which applies
``/t3:todos`` § "Harness-TODO maintenance" (and the ``tasks reconcile-checklist``
emitter) with its own ``TaskList`` / ``TaskUpdate`` / ``TaskCreate`` tools. The
fix is to keep the best-effort disk read OUT of the interactive ``/t3:todos``
path, where the agent can and must read the live list.
